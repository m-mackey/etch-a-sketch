# Etch A Sketch
the [Odin Project Etch-a-Sketch Lesson](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-etch-a-sketch) Project.

Like a etch-a-sketch, the user can "draw" by mousing over pixels,
and set the canvas to a size of their choosing (up to 100x100). 

I did both bonus objectives of having the pixel color be randomized and the opacity increasing on mouseover. I personally prefer the
black color only version (with increasing opacity) because it feels more like actually drawing. I did add a reset button because not having
one bothered me. 

A small thing I'm proud of is figuring out the calculation for the canvas flex basis. Being a grid use of Grid would be ideal, but at
this point in the lessons one has only learned Flexbox, so I wanted to see if I could figure it out with that instead.  And it works
out well! Learning that NaN === NaN is false was also new and interesting.
